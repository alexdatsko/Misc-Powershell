If MME hosted standard RD Gateway is used, we will have a hard time figuring out what hostname the RD Gateway connections are coming from to kick off a user, because they don't seem to capture the hostname of the device connecting in, just the WAN IP, which will be the same for the whole office
However, we may in the future be able to capture the timing of this request to figure out which machine on the network is connecting.
