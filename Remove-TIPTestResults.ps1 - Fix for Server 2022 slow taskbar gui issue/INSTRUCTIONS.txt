This will fix a known issue with Server 2022 Termservers, after many logons, the taskbar GUI eventually will slow down quite a bit due to tons of registry entries in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Software\Microsoft\TIP\TestResults.  This will cause the GUI to slow down over time quite a bit on busier servers.

So, this script will delete all of them, weekly, this will improve the performance again.

1) Create a folder on your server called C:\Scripts and drop these files in it
2) Open Task Scheduler - Win-R taskschd.msc 
3) Right click in the white area and Import task. Select the xml file in c:\Scripts.
4) Click on the 'Change User or Group' button, we will be selecting the Administrator.  If its a Termserver, you could run as Termserver admin if you know the local/DSRM password, otherwise, select the domain by clicking 'Locations', and the domain will be under 'Entire Directory'. Select this and hit OK
5) Type the user name in the box and hit Check Names. Hit OK, or select the right user then hit OK.
6) Hit OK to add the task, and type in the Administrator password
7) You can now test this task by running it: right click it and Run.  
8) You should be able to navigate to this in regedit to double check:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Software\Microsoft\TIP\TestResults
9) If the results are empty or nearly empty, you should be good to go.
