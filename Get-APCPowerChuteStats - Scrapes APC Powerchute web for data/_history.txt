06-xx-20 - Started initial recon, testing and script .  Pulled requests and responses to login of Powerchute 9.5 from MME Lab pc.  
         - Due to javascript I am not able to complete the login process:  POST /j_security_check;27fce5a4fb7ad280=node02sc3y6hb6aw5bpssj6n2icyr1.node0 HTTP/1.1
         - This part doesn't look automatable right now unless I can generate this via the browser/js, maybe I just look at the code closer, but it seems not immediately tamperable
