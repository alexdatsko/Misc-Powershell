Current version: 0.1

2020-06-05 - Started script.  Still not logging events, but it tries to start all automatic services for 15 minutes.
2020-06-08 - Kaler's Dolphin Scheduled job service was not stopped, but had an Unhandled Exception .NET error.  Tried adding some code to look for this error and restart the service (also create a little popup for our PSMA guys so they know).

To do: 
-Create event for script starting stuff in MME Event log
-Interface w/ popup reporter ?
