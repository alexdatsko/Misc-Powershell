05-22-20 - Figured out the format and logistics of data needed.  Created script to grab the sizes of files and drives and calculate stats.  Added code to save in CSV File.  
07-01-20 - Added a function for Veeam , started one for Event logs but was running into weird issues
         - Started some pseudocode for how I am going to handle the incremental backups, and not using a static Backup file name, Veeam and Acronis 12.5 will both have this issue
         - Lots of code fixes getting this to run.
