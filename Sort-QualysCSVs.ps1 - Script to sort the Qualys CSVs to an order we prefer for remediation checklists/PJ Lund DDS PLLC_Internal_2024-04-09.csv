Workaround: Option1: Enable the following GPO to prevent non-admins from installing any Windows App packages. BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser. Specifically, how that looks to the user will depend on the construction of the page that tries to launch the protocol.

Workaround: Option1: Enable the following GPO to prevent non-admins from installing any Windows App packages. BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser. Specifically, how that looks to the user will depend on the construction of the page that tries to launch the protocol.

BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser.

Workaround: Option1: Enable the following GPO to prevent non-admins from installing any Windows App packages. BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser. Specifically, how that looks to the user will depend on the construction of the page that tries to launch the protocol.

Workaround: Option1: Enable the following GPO to prevent non-admins from installing any Windows App packages. BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser. Specifically, how that looks to the user will depend on the construction of the page that tries to launch the protocol.

BlockNonAdminUserInstall- This policy setting manages the ability of non-administrator users to install (signed) Windows app packages. When enabled (value: 1), non-administrator users will be unable to initiate the installation of (signed) Windows app packages.  Option2: Enable this GPO to prevent installing apps from outside the Microsoft Store AllowAllTrustedAppToInstall- This policy setting allows you to manage the installation of trusted line-of-business (LOB) or developer-signed Windows Store apps.If you enable this policy setting, you can install any LOB or developer-signed Windows Store app (which must be signed with a certificate chain that can be successfully validated by the local computer)  Option3: Disable the ms-appinstaller protocol to install apps directly from a website. ms-appinstaller- This will block all attempts to invoke the protocol from the browser.
