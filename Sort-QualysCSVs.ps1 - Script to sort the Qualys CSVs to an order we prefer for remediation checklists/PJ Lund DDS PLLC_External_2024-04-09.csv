For examples HTTP cookies are either base64 encoded or hex digits. This information can help the attacker in their efforts to recover the cookie.","-","true","-","4/9/2024, 3:31:41 AM","-","-","-","-","Windows Vista / Windows 2008 / Windows 7 / Windows 2012 / Windows 8 / Windows 10","-","false","-","38881","tcp","-","38601","38601","38601","CIPHER	KEY-EXCHANGE	AUTHENTICATION	MAC	ENCRYPTION(KEY-STRENGTH)	GRADE TLSv1 WITH RC4 CIPHERS IS SUPPORTED	 	 	 	 	  RC4-SHA	RSA	RSA	SHA1	RC4(128)	MEDIUM TLSv1.1 WITH RC4 CIPHERS IS SUPPORTED	 	 	 	 	  RC4-SHA	RSA	RSA	SHA1	RC4(128)	MEDIUM TLSv1.2 WITH RC4 CIPHERS IS SUPPORTED	 	 	 	 	  RC4-SHA	RSA	RSA	SHA1	RC4(128)	MEDIUM","over ssl","New","a29Ri000001vebIIAQ","3","RC4 should not be used where possible. One reason that RC4(Arcfour) was still being used was BEAST and Lucky13 attacks against CBC mode ciphers in SSL and TLS. However, TLSv 1.2 or later address these issues.","4/9/2024, 3:31:41 AM","Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS ) protocols provide integrity, confidentiality and authenticity services to other protocols that lack these features.   SSL/TLS protocols use ciphers such as AES,DES, 3DES and RC4(Arcfour) to encrypt the content of the higher layer protocols and thus provide the confidentiality service. Normally the output of an encryption process is a sequence of random looking bytes. It was known that RC4 output has some bias in the output. Recently a group of researchers has discovered that there is a stronger bias in RC4(Arcfour) , which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical.   The described attack is to inject a malicious javascript into the victim's browser that would ensure that there are multiple connections being established with a target website and the same HTTP cookie is sent multiple times to the website in encrypted form. This provides the attacker a large set of ciphertext samples that can be used for statistical analysis.  NOTE: On 3/12/15 NVD changed the CVSS v2 access complicity from high to medium. As a result Qualys revised the CVSS score to 4.3 immediately. On 5/4/15 Qualys is also revising the severity to level 3.","-","-","-","Vuln","-","tcp","-","QSD - 21708665","Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) Use of Weak Cipher Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4/ARC4/ARCFOUR)","false"
