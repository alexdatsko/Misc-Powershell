This should fix the Dolphin services crashing / going dead after maintenance or a reboot or backups or whatever else causes them to go not responding eventually.

-You might need to replace the following variables in each script, unless you place these in the folder:
D:\Backups (DO NOT DELETE)\Scripts

-Also, the default folder for the reports (will be created automatically) is: 
D:\Backups (DO NOT DELETE)\Reports\DolphinOcean

-In the scripts, to change the folder, you would need to modify these as needed:

$BackupsDrive="D:"
$BackupsFolder="Backups (DO NOT DELETE)"
$ReportFolder = "$BackupsDrive\$BackupsFolder\Reports\DolphinOcean"

-You would also need to modify the scheduled task location:

      <Command>c:\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe</Command>
      <Arguments>-exec bypass -file "D:\Backups (DO NOT DELETE)\Scripts\Start-DolphinScheduledJobService.ps1"</Arguments>
