This should fix the Dolphin services crashing / going dead after maintenance or a reboot or backups or whatever else causes them to go not responding eventually.

History:
0.01 - 10/2022 - first version
0.03 - 10/2023 - fixed a bug in the Ocean script that causes it to not restart every day.  Updated for better logging, cleanup reports over 365 days old, etc.
               - also set up scheduled task to run 15m after startup, and re-exported task xmls
